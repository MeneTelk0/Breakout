## Overview
The game is impossibly simple - the user has at his disposal a platform that he can control, and a ball that needs to be curbed!  To win - go through all levels and get the highest rating for the number of broken blocks.  Bonuses will help you with this, but beware of traps!

## Main Features
- Fancy and Retro graphics!
- Masohistic gameplay with increasing speed!
- Lots of bonuses and traps, to make your breakout journey more challenging!
- Compete with friends - we have Ratings in our game!
- Intuitive controls with mouse pointer or arrow keys
- And last but not least - Super Cool Soundtrack! Just give it a try!

## Realisation

Frontend is fully made with the usage of JavaScript . In the Backend there are some python scripts to gain access to the PostgreSQL DataBase with ratings. Everything runs on a Python CGI Server - so it is quite easy to reproduce on your local machine.

- Python Backend
- PostgreSQL DB
- Python CGI server

## Usage 

To set up PostgreSQL DB and CGI server - look into [tutorial](https://github.com/MeneTelk0/Breakout/blob/master/tutorial_postgres.pdf) (currently in Russian).

After that - open 127.0.0.1:8000 in your favorite (in our opinion) browser and enjoy.

At this moment **Firefox**(version >= 76.0.1)(recommended) and **Chromium**(version >= 81.0.4044.138) are supported.
